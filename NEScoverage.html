      <h2>A short report:</h2>
      <h3>National Education Summit Organised by Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini</h3>
      <p>With the divine blessings of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, a 3-day conference was held at the Sai Hira Global Convention Centre, Prasanthi Nilayam, from July 5-7, 2024. 
        The transformative event was hosted by the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust on behalf of its digital education initiative, Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini. The theme of the summit 
        was ‘Integral to Inclusive,’ with each session designed to provoke thought and inspire decisive action. Participants included National Education Policy architects, 
        policymakers, thought leaders, trainers, teachers, and EdTech experts from the government, private, and philanthropic sectors, all aligned to improve the education 
        landscape in the world, starting with Bharat.</p>
      <p>
        In a simple and elegant function, the sacred lamp was lit to signal the inauguration of the summit by the Chancellor, 
        Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning and Chairman, Sri Sathya Sai Global Council, and SSSCT member Shri K. Chakravarthi IAS retd, Shri Naganand, Trustee, SSSSCT, 
        Shri R.J. Ratnakar, Managing Trustee, SSSCT, Prof. Raghavendra Prasad, Vice Chancellor, SSSIHL, and Prof. Indu Kumar of CIET-NCERT.
      </p>
       <p >Sri RJ Rathnakar, Managing Trustee of Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, highlighted in his welcome address how Swami started the concept of &lsquo;Educare&rsquo; 
         more than five decades ago, distinguishing it from the regular education ecosystem. He applauded the unparalleled dedication of the SSSVV volunteers, 
         attributing it to their devotion to Swami.</p><p >Smt. Karuna Munshi, Director of SSSVV, spoke on the genesis of the SSSVV programme initiated on Bhagawan&rsquo;s 
           85th birthday in 2010. She recalled how the programme gained national traction during COVID-19 and how MoUs were signed with the DIKSHA portal, NCERT-CIET, NITI Aayog, 
           and the project&rsquo;s growth trajectory.</p>
      <p >Prof. B. Raghavendra Prasad, Vice Chancellor of SSSIHL, addressed the audience on how ethics and values are imparted in this modern Gurukula to provide a 
        holistic framework for interpersonal development. At the inauguration of the women&rsquo;s campus at Anantapur in 1969, Bhagawan said, &ldquo;This institute has not been established 
        just to prepare you for earning degrees. The main purpose is to help you cultivate self-knowledge and self-confidence so that each one of you can learn self-sacrifice and earn self-realisation.
        &rdquo; Leveraging technology for remote access, the SSSVV programme calls upon the altruistic attitude of enthusiastic volunteers with education, training, and technology backgrounds to 
        achieve the dream of Integral Education for All, Integral Education by All.</p>
      <p >Prof. M.K. Sridhar of the NEP Drafting Committee outlined the salient features of NEP 2020 and NCF, 
          which found common ground in SSSVV. Dr. Dakshayini Kanna, academic consultant of SSSVV, explained how SSSVV fulfilled digitally 
            the&nbsp;needs of all. This was followed by an erudite keynote address by Prof. Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras on the Next Gen&nbsp;learners, 
      and Prof. Indu Kumar, Professor and Head Department of ICT and Training Division, CIET-NCERT, who navigated the audience through the NIPUN Bharat mission. In-house presentations by team 
      leads of SSSVV helped the audience appreciate the depth and reach of the various deliverables of SSSVV.&nbsp;</p>

      <p >The second day began with a session on SSSSVV-supported schools - implementation and sustenance by Sri Durga Prasad and Smt. Vidya Swaminathan from the state leadership 
        teams of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, respectively. They detailed the processes SSSVV uses to onboard interested schools, from assessing their readiness to supporting them until 
        they become lighthouse schools. Currently, 68 schools across 13 states in India are strengthening themselves as SSSVV&nbsp;schools of which 12 have been identified as Lighthouse schools. 
        Testimonials from school leadership emphasised the extensive reach and impact of Vidya Vahini across the four domains of learning: classroom, corridor, campus, and community.</p>
      <p >The theme of corporate firms competing to partner with an NGO like SSSVV, which is transforming the educational landscape as envisioned by Bhagawan, was highlighted in the 
        next presentation by two alumni of SSSIHL turned corporate veterans, Sri Ramesh Kunnath, Operations Leader at PWC Acceleration Centre, and Smt. N. Raj, Managing Director at 
        a leading accounting firm. The Employee Engagement Programme at an American firm, celebrating a ten-year milestone of collaboration with SSSVV, 
      has over the years seen 65,000 employees volunteer across Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. SriVikas Aggarwal, Partner at EY LLP, New Delhi, assured that digital tools 
      can never replace the warmth of a teacher but can act as a force multiplier to drive quality education at scale. He spoke on scaling philanthropic digital education initiatives.</p>
      <p >The exquisitely designed Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini Inclusive Project website was offered to Bhagawan and dedicated to the world by Shri R.J. Ratnakar, 
        Managing Trustee of the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, the parent body of SSSVV. An MoU with AIISH Mysore was exchanged with the SSSCT to develop content and learning 
        aids for the speech and hearing impaired. This was followed by the unveiling of the SSSVV anthem, penned by Smt. Priya Tandon and set to music by Shri Sai Vignesh of Kantara fame. 
        The singers and the team behind the composition were elegantly felicitated, marking the joyous proceedings.</p>
      <p >Prof. Uday Kiran from the Department of Mathematics, SSSIHL, highlighted the crucial role of data analytics in providing opportunities for neurodiverse students. 
        Through engaging anecdotes, games, and apps, he explained the use of pattern detection in strength-based education. The postgraduate students involved in creating 
        these apps were felicitated. Dr. Bharati Kaushik, Associate Professor at CIET-NCERT, presented on the entire gamut of inclusive education and the vision of NEP 2020 
        in her interactive session on unlocking potential: inclusive education and PRASHAST. She discussed current educational challenges and emphasised the importance of 
        self-acceptance before extending unconditional love and support to children with special needs. Inclusive education project managers, Dr. Srividya Sridhar, 
        Shri Saurabh Saxena, and Shri Taranath Kotian, explained the what, why, and how of the inclusive project, outlining the roadmap from its inception to future goals.</p>
      <p  id="h.gjdgxs">Dr. Mallika Ganapathy, Consultant Educator, discussed the learning disabilities faced by children and suggested pedagogic practices through 
        interesting case studies that can overcome barriers and ease their educational journey. These accommodations, though minimal, empower children with learning disabilities, 
        making their educational experience more fulfilling. Dr. P. Manjula, Professor and Dean of Research at AIISH, Mysore, highlighted the institute&#39;s various services and 
        the importance of early intervention for rehabilitation. She explained ideal classroom features and the significance of collaborating with teachers and peers. Prof. Victoria Naomi, 
        former Dean of the School of Education at Avinashilingam University, emphasised the need for expanding vision and fostering inclusion for individuals with visual impairments. 
        She discussed the importance of breaking the cycle of illiteracy, poverty, and social exclusion for such children to lead dignified and independent lives. Technology has 
        revolutionised the field with assistive devices like refreshable braille, read-easy-move, screen magnifiers, and braille embossers. 
        Overcoming the stigma and challenges associated with disabilities often requires transforming the mindset behind the barriers. </p>

      <p >The final day&rsquo;s proceedings commenced with a soulful bhajan rendition by Ms. Menuka Poudel, a participant of the reality show, 
        Indian Idol. This was followed by an introduction to neurodiversity through a video presentation by Shri. Justin Jesudas, 
        Head of Operations and Centre Manager at R2D2 IIT Madras, who elucidated the disability landscape and the assistive technologies that 
        help individuals with disabilities lead lives of dignity. GPTs are revolutionising the world and offering potential solutions to global problems. 
        In his impactful speech on decoding the value of human values in today&rsquo;s education, Prof. M. M. Ananth, Founder of AcadNet and former Vice Chancellor of 
        Adani University, focused on the current state of education, which does not talk of the source but comes with force. He advocated for Bhagawan&#39;s peace formula as a 
        guidepost for integrating emotional and spiritual quotients into education.</p>
      <p >Prof. Amarendra Behera, Joint Director of NCERT-CIET, delivered a brief address via video. Prof. Anupam Ahuja, Professor and Former Head of the International Relations 
        Division and the Department of Education of Groups with Special Needs at NCERT, passionately urged for the celebration of diversity in classrooms, 
        emphasising that every learner matters equally. Smt. Ambica Subramanian, Centre Head of Vidyaniketan Academy, highlighted that leadership in 
        inclusive education should focus on ensuring equity, diversity, and respect for all students. Dr. Onita Nakra, an educational psychologist from Dubai, 
        discussed &quot;Cognitive Education for Diverse Learners&mdash;The Missing Piece,&quot; advocating for differentiated instruction in the curriculum. 
        This set the stage for the Global Summit on Education 2025, with a brief curtain-raiser&nbsp;following her presentation.</p>
      <p >Shri. Kamaraju Turaga summarised the key takeaways and action points from NES 2024. The event concluded with a question-and-answer session moderated by 
        Shri. V.L. Subramanian, Head of Strategy, Planning, and Operations at SSSVV, and a vote of thanks by Dr. Radhika Rani Rao. The national anthem and mangal aarthi marked a&nbsp;fitting finale 
        to the three-day National Education Summit 2024.</p>
