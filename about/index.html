        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-18">
            <strong>Q1. &nbsp; What is the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini program about?</strong><br>The Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini program is a comprehensive framework that delivers school curriculum digitally, as per the National Education Policy 2020. It transforms the process of learning into an inspiring, insightful, enjoyable and participative experience. It offers a balance of academic excellence and character education by integrating human values within the secular framework. It is inclusive and involves activity based learning and colourful multimedia. It is primarily aimed at empowering teachers by providing them with world-class content in the form of master lesson plans compiled through a process of global collaboration by experts. Apart from content, the program also offers training, teaching aids, an English language proficiency program for teachers and much more. Our offerings cover the four domains of classroom, corridor, campus and community. As the program is delivered through technology, anyone, anywhere can access it with ease and without any cost attached. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Q2. &nbsp; How did the project get the name Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini (SSSVV)?</strong><br>When a few names were presented to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba for consideration, He immediately selected ‘Vidya Vahini’. Then, in His unassuming and endearing manner, He asked, “Do you know that there is also a book by that name?” Not once did He say that He had written the book! &nbsp;Worth a read by anyone in the field of education, the book Vidya Vahini authored by Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba is a repository of deep wisdom and insights. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Q3. &nbsp; What is the aim of the SSSVV program?</strong><br>The numeracy and literacy gap between rural and urban India is continuing to grow. Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini aims to bridge the same by extending the well-established benefits of the Sri Sathya Sai model of integrated education to everyone through the use of technology. Due to its digital advantage, the program universalizes access to quality education that promotes academic excellence, character building, responsible citizenship, social justice, environmental sensitivity, inclusion and much more. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Q4. &nbsp; When was this project initiated?</strong><br>Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba blessed the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini project on 6th May 2010. It was formally inaugurated on November 23, 2010. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Q5. &nbsp; Who is the program aimed at?<br>‍</strong>The mandate of the program is to empower teachers, especially rural teachers so that no child is left behind in India’s growth story. By providing teachers free access to a rich repository of digital teaching aids in the form of ready-to-use content (master lesson plans), training, teaching-aids, English language proficiency and many more resources, we hope to extend the benefits of the Sri Sathya Sai Education model already flourishing in the valley of Prasanthi Nilayam to teachers and their students everywhere. &nbsp;All components of the SSSVV offerings are embedded with values as per the National Curriculum Framework and are poised to meet the UNESCO 2030 goals.<br><br>

            <strong>Q8. &nbsp; I am a Bal Vikas guru. How can I work in Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini?<br>‍</strong>We have a dedicated human values team that seamlessly integrates the NCF listed human values into our lesson plans.

            <strong>Q9. I am neither an educator nor a Bal Vikas guru. Can I still volunteer?<br>‍</strong>Yes, you can! If you have reasonable proficiency in the English language, you can join our English proficiency program Phone-Your-Friend (PYF) as a mentor.If you have a training background, you can enroll in our training team to serve as an online or in-person trainer. If you have a technology program background, we definitely want to hear from you as we are driven and delivered entirely through the digital medium. If you are a tester, especially of mobile apps, we welcome you. If you are a detail-oriented person with good admin experience, patience of an elephant and good people skills, you can help us in coordinating and tracking various teams.If you can read, write/type and speak English and one of the following languages - Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada or Odiya, we need your help to translate our State Boards&apos; syllabi from English to vernacular. If design, multimedia and creativity are your cup of tea, our multimedia team will be happy to hear from you. Must have competencies - apart from the above-listed skills, basic computer literacy, a heart full of selfless love, a passion to serve society without any discrimination and an ability to work with team spirit are mandatory.

            <strong>Q10. Why should I volunteer for SSSVV?<br>‍</strong>Give back to receive more or give back because we have received so much! Participation in SSSVV is a methodical route to channelize your talent, skills, knowledge and insights for a greater good whereby future citizens of our nation will benefit from a sound learning paradigm. SSSVV offers volunteering opportunities within large teams of professionally qualified, motivated and generous-spirited individuals. Working with them for the noble cause of providing integral education to all is the surest path to self-transformation. More than the service recipient, it is the seva provider who benefits the most as self-transformation is the final goal of any giving back to society with selflessness. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Q11. There are plenty of digital teacher resources available in the EdTech space. What sets SSSVV apart?<br>‍</strong>Glad you asked! Being available digitally, SSSVV democratizes access to quality education for everyone. SSSVV trades only in the currency of selfless love. No payment is involved. As with all the humanitarian projects run by our parent body the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust, all SSSVV offerings are also provided totally free of cost in the service of the nation’s teachers and students. SSSVV is driven entirely by selflessness of volunteers around the world who are experts in subject matter, pedagogy, human values, language, multimedia, technology – it is a confluence of latest pedagogy, human values and cutting edge technology, all driven by the spirit of altruism. SSSVV is an ideal example of a global education collaboration, driven by purity of purpose and passion to serve rather than profit. <br><br>
