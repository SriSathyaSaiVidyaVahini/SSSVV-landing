        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-18"><strong>Q1. &nbsp; What is the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini program about?</strong><br>The Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini program is a comprehensive framework that delivers school curriculum digitally, as per the National Education Policy 2020. It transforms the process of learning into an inspiring, insightful, enjoyable and participative experience. It offers a balance of academic excellence and character education by integrating human values within the secular framework. It is inclusive and involves activity based learning and colourful multimedia. It is primarily aimed at empowering teachers by providing them with world-class content in the form of master lesson plans compiled through a process of global collaboration by experts. Apart from content, the program also offers training, teaching aids, an English language proficiency program for teachers and much more. Our offerings cover the four domains of classroom, corridor, campus and community. As the program is delivered through technology, anyone, anywhere can access it with ease and without any cost attached. <br><br><strong>Q2. &nbsp; How did the project get the name Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini (SSSVV)?</strong><br>When a few names were presented to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba for consideration, He immediately selected ‘Vidya Vahini’. Then, in His typically unassuming and endearing manner, He asked, “Do you know that there is also a book by that name?” Not once did He say that He had written the book! &nbsp;Worth a read by anyone in the field of education, the book Vidya Vahini authored by Bhagawan Baba is a repository of deep wisdom and insights. <br><br><strong>Q3. &nbsp; What is the aim of the SSSVV program?</strong><br>The numeracy and literacy gap between rural and urban schools is continuing to grow in India. Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini aims to bridge the same by extending the well-established benefits of the Sri Sathya Sai model of integrated education to everyone through the use of technology. Due to its digital advantage, the program universalizes access to quality education that promotes academic excellence, character building, responsible citizenship, social justice, environmental sensitivity, inclusion and much more. <br><br><strong>Q4. &nbsp; When was this project initiated?</strong><br>Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba blessed the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vahini project on 6th May 2010.
